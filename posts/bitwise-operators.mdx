After discovering bitwise flags I've become amazed by their wide-reaching uses and implementations. I first came across bitwise flags when working with the Discord API, where they are used for denoting and storing a user's permissions - indeed this is quite a common usecase. However, I've since realised they have even further-reaching uses, such as storing states and truthy/falsy information about a user.

## Bit Operators

It's important to have an understanding of the key operators when working with bitwise flags - because these flags operate on the bit level, and thus you need to know how to manipulate the bits.

### `OR` Operator

The `OR` operator will return a **1** if **at least** one of the input bits is **1**. In my examples below, this operator will be represented by an `|` symbol.

| A   | B   | A\|B |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   | 1    |
| 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1   | 1    |

For example: `5 | 1` written in binary is `0101 | 0001`, and thus the result is `0101` or `5`, because only the 2nd and 4th bit have '1's'.

### `AND` Operator

The `AND` operator will return a **1** if **both** of the input bit sare **1**. In my examples below, this operator will be represented by an `&` symbol.

| A   | B   | A&B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

For example: `5 & 1` written in binary is `0101 & 0001`, and thus the result is `0001` or `1`, because the last bit is the only shared '1'.

### `XOR` Operator

The `XOR` operator will return a **1** if **only one** of the input bits is **1**. In my examples below, this operator will be represented by an `^` symbol.

| A   | B   | A^B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

For example: `5 ^ 1` written in binary is `0101 ^ 0001`, and thus the result is `0100` or `4`, because the 2nd bit is the only non-shared 1.

### `NOT` Operator

The `NOT` operator will invert the value of all input bits. In my examples below, this operator will be represented by an `~` symbol.

For example: `~5` written in binary is `~0101`, and thus the result is `1010`or`10`.

### `Left Shift` Operator

The `Left Shift` operator will push zeros in from the right, with the leftmost bits falling off the value. In my examples below, this operator will be repesetned by an `<<` symbol.

For example: `5 << 1` written in binary is `0101 << 0001`, which results in `1010`, which is equal to `10`.

### `Right Shift` Operator

The `Right Shift` operator will push zeros in from the left, with the rightmost bits falling off the value. In my examples below, this operator will be repesetned by an `>>` symbol.

For example: `5 >> 1` written in binary is `0101 >> 0001`, which results in `0010`, which is equal to `2`.

## What Are Bitwise Flags - And How do I Use Them?

Bitwise flags are an efficient method of storing multiple ON/OFF values in the same value - removing the need for storing several values in a database. For example, what may previously be stored as:

```js
const user = {
    name: 'Toby Chambers',
    flags: {
        ACCESS1 = true,
        ACCESS2 = false,
        ACCESS3 = true,
    }
}
```

Could instead be represented as:

```js
const {
    ADMINISTRATOR = 1 << 0, // (1)
    EMAIL_VERIFIED = 1 << 1, // (2)
    PHONE_VERIFIED = 1 << 3, // (4)
}

const user = {
    name: 'Toby Chambers',
    flags: 4
}
```

### Checking if a Flag Exists

Bitwise flags allow us to easily check if a flag exists, by simply checking if a user's 'flag value' includes that flag bit, for example:

```js
const ADMINISTRATOR = 1 << 0, // (1)
  EMAIL_VERIFIED = 1 << 1, // (2)
  PHONE_VERIFIED = 1 << 2; // (4)

const user = {
  name: 'Toby Chambers',
  flags: 3,
};

const hasAdministratorFlag = (ADMINISTRATOR & user.flags) === ADMINISTRATOR ? true : false;
const hasEmailVerifiedFlag = (EMAIL_VERIFIED & user.flags) === EMAIL_VERIFIED ? true : false;
const hasPhoneVerifiedFlag = (PHONE_VERIFIED & user.flags) === PHONE_VERIFIED ? true : false;
```

In this example, `hasAdministratorFlag` and `hasEmailVerifiedFlag` would be true.

### Creating a Flags value

Creating / updating the flags value that stores the bitwise flags is very simple. We can do this by simply adding the relevant bits that are associated with the flag(s) we'd like to add.

In my example, this can be done like so:

```js
user.flags = user.flags | ADMINISTRATOR;
```

Or, if we'd like to add multiple flags:

```js
user.flags = user.flags | ADMINISTRATOR | EMAIL_VERIFIED | PHONE_VERIFIED;
```
